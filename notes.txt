Channels names are strings (beginning with a '&', '#', '+' or '!' character) of length up to fifty (50) characters.
Channel names are case insensitive.

Once a user has joined a channel, he receives information about all commands his server receives affecting the channel.  This
includes JOIN, MODE, KICK, PART, QUIT and of course PRIVMSG/NOTICE.
This allows channel members to keep track of the other channel members, as well as channel modes.
